# RecommendR

This was a short-term project in June 2017 to create recommendations for R packages to consider based on a selection of packages one is already interested in using.  The data is from  [GitHub bigquery data set](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github) and from man pages of packages in CRAN or Bioconductor, but is from June 2017 so newer packages or packages not on CRAN/BioC at that time are not included.  The app is currently hosted at http://recommendr.info/
